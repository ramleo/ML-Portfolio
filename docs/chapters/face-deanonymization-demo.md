# Face Deanonymization Demo

## What problem it solves

Most people's mental model of facial recognition is a police database: a
curated list of known individuals, deliberately assembled. That model makes it
feel distant and bounded.

The reality is closer to a search engine. A face becomes a vector, every vector
goes into an index, and identification is a nearest-neighbour lookup. There is
no list of known individuals — there is a photo, and everything the crawler
ever collected, and a similarity ranking. Scale is the only ingredient that
changes.

This tool makes that mechanism concrete without touching anyone's real data.
You supply a target photo and up to ten gallery photos. It embeds every
detected face with the same model, ranks the gallery by cosine similarity to
the target, and shows the scores. That is the whole of the algorithm behind
Clearview-style re-identification — the difference between this demo and the
real thing is entirely the size of the gallery.

Then it lets you break it. One button cloaks the target using the Face Cloak
tool's existing endpoint and re-runs the identical search, so you can watch a
99% match collapse.

**Scope, stated plainly:** it does not search the internet, any database, or
any stored index. It compares only the photos you upload in that one request,
and nothing is retained.

## How it works, step by step

1. **Upload a target photo and one to ten gallery photos.**
2. **For each photo**, detect the face, take the highest-confidence detection,
   expand the box by 1.6×.
3. **Embed each face** into a 512-dimensional L2-normalised vector.
4. **Compute cosine similarity** between the target's vector and each gallery
   vector.
5. **Rank the gallery** and label each result same, uncertain or different.
6. **Optionally: "Protect and re-test."** The target is sent to Face Cloak's
   endpoint, and the same search is run again against the same gallery.

## The model or algorithm

### One embedding model, imported not duplicated

The face embedding is InceptionResnetV1 on VGGFace2 — described in full in the
Face Cloak chapter, since that tool owns it.

What is worth noting is the structure. This module imports `_ensure_loaded`,
`_face_crop_box`, `_embed`, `_FACE_LABELS` and both similarity thresholds
**directly from `mm_face_cloak`**. It adds no face-embedding code of its own
and shares the single loaded model instance.

That is deliberate and it matters for the demonstration's credibility. If the
attack tool and the defence tool each had their own copy of the embedding
pipeline, any measured difference between them could be an artefact of a
divergence in crop margins or normalisation. Sharing the exact code means the
"protect and re-test" result is a genuine before-and-after on one pipeline,
not a comparison of two implementations. It also means the 112 MB of weights
are loaded once regardless of which tool the visitor opens first.

The same thresholds are reused, mapped to a three-way verdict:

| Cosine similarity | Verdict |
|---|---|
| ≥ 0.5 | **same** |
| 0.3 – 0.5 | **uncertain** |
| < 0.3 | **different** |

The middle band is the important one. A two-way classifier would force every
comparison into a confident answer; the uncertain band is where a real system
should defer to a human, and its existence in the output is part of what the
tool is teaching.

### The search

For L2-normalised vectors, cosine similarity is the dot product, and the whole
search is:

```
similarity[i] = target_embedding · gallery_embedding[i]
```

Sort descending, take the top. Ten photos or ten billion, the operation is
identical — at scale it becomes an approximate nearest-neighbour index like
FAISS or HNSW, but the mathematics does not change. That equivalence is the
point of the demo.

Photos where no face is detected are returned marked `found_face: false` rather
than dropped. A missing photo in the results would look like a failed upload; a
photo explicitly marked as having no detectable face tells you the detector, not
the matcher, is what declined.

### Verified results

Two distinct real people, tested against the deployed service:

| Comparison | Similarity | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Same person, different photos | **0.99** | same |
| Different person | **0.46** | uncertain |
| Same person, after cloaking the target | **−0.77** | different |

Three things are worth pulling out of that table.

**The same-person match at 0.99 is the demonstration working.** Two different
photographs, ranked as the same individual by a general-purpose model with no
training on either person.

**The different-person score of 0.46 landed in "uncertain", not "different".**
That is the honest result and it was kept. 0.46 is under the same-person
threshold, so the system did not make a false match — but it is well inside the
grey band, and with a larger gallery a score like that would be a plausible
false positive. This is precisely what makes deployment at scale dangerous: the
base rate. Against ten photos, 0.46 is noise. Against ten million, a threshold
that produces even rare scores in that range produces a steady stream of wrong
people.

**Cloaking moved 0.99 to −0.77 and flipped the verdict.** The countermeasure
defeating the identification the same tool had just performed, measured on the
same pipeline in the same session.

## Why these choices

**Why require the user to supply the gallery?** Because the alternative is
building a face database, which is the thing this tool exists to criticise. The
mechanism demonstrates perfectly well on ten photos. Bundling a corpus of real
people's faces to make the demo more impressive would mean doing the harm in
order to illustrate it.

**Why cap the gallery at ten?** Each photo needs a detection pass and an
embedding pass, and the request has to complete. Ten is enough to show ranking
behaviour and small enough to stay within a request budget on a CPU-only host.

**Why show every score rather than only the best match?** Because the
distribution is the lesson. A single "match found" tells you nothing about how
close the runners-up were. Seeing that the correct person scored 0.99 and
someone else scored 0.46 tells you where the decision boundary sits and how
much margin it has — which is exactly what a vendor's accuracy claim hides.

**Why build the attack demo at all, when the defence already existed?** Because
the defence could not previously demonstrate anything. Face Cloak measured the
cloaked photo against the photo's *own* original embedding — a real number, but
a self-comparison. It never showed an actual identification succeeding, so it
could never show one being prevented. This tool supplies the missing half, and
the two together make a complete argument.

**Why is the cloaking button a call to the existing endpoint rather than new
code?** So the defence being demonstrated is the shipped one, unmodified. A
re-implementation tuned for the demo would prove nothing about the tool people
actually use.

## How to read the output

**Read the gap, not the top score.** A best match of 0.9 with the runner-up at
0.4 is a confident identification. A best match of 0.55 with the runner-up at
0.52 is a coin flip that happened to rank one way, and at scale it is how the
wrong person gets arrested.

**"Uncertain" is the honest answer, not a failure.** The band exists because
the model genuinely does not distinguish those cases reliably.

**A "different" verdict is not proof of a different person.** Bad lighting, a
sharp angle, occlusion, age difference or low resolution all push the
similarity down for the same individual. The false-negative direction is at
least as common as the false-positive one.

**After cloaking, compare all the numbers, not just the verdict.** If the
target's similarity to everyone in the gallery dropped, the cloak moved the
vector; if the ranking merely shuffled, it did not move it far enough.

## Limits

- **No internet search and no database.** Only the photos in the request.
- **Ten gallery photos.** Real systems index billions, and every property that
  makes those systems dangerous — base rates, near-duplicate collisions,
  demographic error skew — needs scale to appear.
- **No accuracy measurement.** The numbers here come from a handful of real
  photos. There is no false-match or false-non-match rate, because measuring
  one requires a labelled multi-identity corpus this project does not have.
- **Known demographic bias.** Published evaluations, including NIST's FRVT,
  have repeatedly found face-recognition error rates that differ substantially
  across demographic groups. Nothing here measures or corrects for that, and
  the demo's small scale conceals it entirely.
- **One face per photo** — the highest-confidence detection.
- **The detector gates everything.** A face the object detector misses is
  simply absent from the search, which is a different failure from a low score.
- **The thresholds are heuristic**, inherited from Face Cloak and not
  calibrated for this model.

## Likely interview questions

**"How does large-scale face search actually work?"**
Every face is converted by a neural network into a fixed-length embedding —
512 dimensions here — trained so that the same person's photos land close
together and different people land apart. Identification is then a
nearest-neighbour query in that space, using an approximate index such as FAISS
or HNSW for speed. There is no per-person model and no enrolment step: adding a
new identity means adding a vector.

**"You got 0.46 between two different people. Is that a problem?"**
On its own, no — it stayed under the same-person threshold, so it did not
produce a false match. As a signal about deployment at scale, yes. It sits in
the uncertain band, and the false-positive rate that matters depends on the
base rate. A threshold that yields a 0.46 for an unrelated pair means that in a
gallery of millions, some unrelated pair will exceed 0.5 by chance. That is why
large-scale identification needs a far stricter threshold than verification
does, and why the same model is sound for unlocking your own phone and unsound
for picking a suspect out of a city.

**"What is the difference between verification and identification?"**
Verification is one-to-one: does this face match this claimed identity? The
base rate is favourable and the failure mode is a locked-out user.
Identification is one-to-many: who is this, out of everyone in the index? Every
extra entry is another chance to exceed the threshold, so the false-positive
rate compounds with gallery size and the failure mode is accusing a stranger.
Vendor accuracy figures are frequently quoted from verification benchmarks and
then applied to identification deployments, which is not a valid transfer.

**"Why import the private helpers from the other module instead of writing your
own?"**
Because the whole value of the tool is the before-and-after comparison, and
that comparison is only meaningful if both sides run the identical pipeline. A
separate implementation could differ in crop margin, resize interpolation or
normalisation, and any of those would show up as a similarity change that had
nothing to do with the cloak. It also shares one loaded model instance instead
of two copies of 112 MB in memory.

**"Isn't building this irresponsible?"**
The mechanism is published, the models are freely downloadable, and the
commercial systems already exist at scale. Nothing here lowers the barrier for
someone intent on building one. What it does is make the mechanism legible to
people who are subject to it, and pair it with a working countermeasure in the
same interface. The constraints are what keep that defensible: user-supplied
photos only, no stored index, no internet lookup, nothing retained.

**"How would you defend against this if you ran a platform?"**
On the platform side: strip metadata, rate-limit and detect bulk scraping,
serve resized images, and treat automated harvesting as an abuse category with
teeth. On the individual side, cloaking of the kind in the paired tool here,
with the caveat that it only protects photos not already collected. And
realistically, the durable answer is legal rather than technical — Illinois's
BIPA and the GDPR's special-category rules for biometric data have changed
commercial behaviour more than any perturbation has.
