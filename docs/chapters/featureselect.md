## What problem it solves

Feature Engineering makes columns. This tool takes them away.

That sounds like undoing the work, and it is exactly the point. More columns is
not more information. Past a certain width a model has enough freedom to fit
noise, every extra column dilutes the ones that matter, training slows down, and
the model becomes impossible to explain to anyone. Two columns that say the same
thing are worse than one, because the credit for the signal gets split between
them and neither looks important.

Deciding what to cut is normally a morning of correlation matrices and
`SelectKBest` calls. This tool runs twelve selection methods over your CSV,
shows what each one would drop and **why**, and writes out the narrowed file.

Like the preprocessing and feature-engineering tools, it runs entirely in your
browser. Every statistic below — variance, correlation, mutual information,
the Lasso path, the trees — is computed in TypeScript on your own machine.

## How it works, step by step

The twelve methods are not alternatives you pick between. They are a **funnel**,
and they run in a fixed order, each one seeing only the columns that survived
the ones before it. Every method has its own on/off switch and its own
threshold, so you decide how many gates the data passes through.

| # | Gate | What it removes |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Variance threshold** | columns whose variance is below your cutoff — a column that barely changes cannot explain a target that does |
| 2 | **Correlation filter** | of any pair correlating above the threshold, the one with the weaker link to the target |
| 3 | **Top-K** | everything outside the K best by association score |
| 4 | **SelectKBest** | as above, but scored by F-regression, ANOVA F, or the association score |
| 5 | **Kendall's τ** | the weakest by rank correlation |
| 6 | **Chi-squared** | the weakest by a contingency-table χ² |
| 7 | **RFE** | eliminated one at a time, weakest first, until K remain |
| 8 | **Lasso** | those the L1 penalty drives to zero |
| 9 | **Ridge** | those with the smallest L2 weights |
| 10 | **Tree importance** | those the trees never split on |
| 11 | **Forward selection** | everything not picked by a greedy forward pass |
| 12 | **Exhaustive search** | everything not in the best-scoring subset |

Then the tool lists every column with the exact reason it was dropped — *"low
variance"*, *"high corr"*, *"RFE r3"*, *"Lasso=0"* — and offers the narrowed CSV.
Alongside the funnel it can also run four **projection** methods: PCA, UMAP,
Factor Analysis and LDA. Those do not select columns, they build new ones; more
on the difference below.

## The model or algorithm

### The association score — and an important honesty note

Almost every gate ranks columns by a single score the interface calls **mutual
information**. Here is what it actually computes:

```
score = −0.5 × log(1 − r²)
```

where `r` is the Pearson correlation with the target.

That formula is real: it is the exact mutual information between two variables
**if you assume they are jointly Gaussian**. It is also the reason the number
behaves the way it does — it goes to zero when `r` is zero and to infinity as
`|r|` approaches one.

But it inherits Pearson's blind spot completely. True mutual information detects
*any* dependence, including a U-shape or a threshold effect. This score detects
**only linear dependence**. A feature that is a perfect parabola of the target
scores zero here, and a genuine mutual-information estimator would score it very
high. *The code does not say why this approximation was chosen; my reading is
that a real MI estimator needs binning or a nearest-neighbour method, both far
slower in a browser and both needing parameters of their own.* Either way, read
the score as "linear association", not as mutual information.

When no target column is chosen, the score falls back to the column's variance.

### The filter methods

**Variance threshold.** Compute each column's variance, drop what falls below
the cutoff. A constant column has variance zero and is pure dead weight. Note
this is scale-dependent — a column measured in millimetres has a thousand times
the variance of the same column in metres — so it is only meaningful on data
that has been standardised, or with a cutoff you have chosen for that column's
units.

**Correlation filter.** For every pair of surviving columns, if `|r|` is at or
above your threshold, one of them goes. The choice of which is the useful part:
the tool keeps whichever has the **stronger association with the target** and
drops the other, rather than dropping arbitrarily or by column order.

**F-regression.** The F statistic for a linear fit, `r²(n−2)/(1−r²)`, which is
what scikit-learn's `f_regression` computes. It is a monotonic function of `r²`,
so it ranks identically to correlation — what it adds is a scale that accounts
for sample size.

**ANOVA F (`f_classif`).** For a categorical target: group the feature's values
by class, then compare the variance *between* the group means with the variance
*within* the groups. A big ratio means the classes separate along this feature.
This is the right test when the target is categorical and the feature is
continuous, and it is genuinely different from correlation.

**Kendall's τ.** A *rank* correlation. Take every pair of rows and ask whether
the feature and the target move the same way; τ is (concordant − discordant)
pairs over the total. Because it only uses order, it catches any monotonic
relationship, not just a straight-line one, and it is unbothered by outliers.
The cost is that it compares every pair, which is O(n²) — the implementation
caps it at the first **500 rows** for that reason.

**Chi-squared.** Cuts the feature into four bins at its quartiles, cross-tabulates
those bins against the target's classes, and sums `(observed − expected)² /
expected` over the table. Large means the feature's distribution changes with
the class. Worth knowing that this differs from scikit-learn's `chi2`, which
requires non-negative features and does not bin — the binning here is what lets
it accept a continuous feature at all, and it costs some resolution.

### The embedded methods

**Lasso.** Linear regression with an L1 penalty on the coefficients. The
distinctive property of L1 is that it drives weak coefficients to **exactly
zero** rather than merely small, so it selects as it fits. The implementation is
coordinate descent with soft thresholding — cycle through the coefficients, and
for each one compute what it would be with the others held fixed, then pull it
toward zero by `alpha` and clip it there if it crosses:

```
w[j] = ρ > α  ?  ρ − α
     : ρ < −α ?  ρ + α
     :           0
```

Up to 200 sweeps, stopping when nothing moves by more than 1e-6. Columns are
standardised first, because an L1 penalty applied to raw units would punish
whichever column happened to be measured in small numbers. Capped at 500 rows.

**Ridge.** The same idea with an L2 penalty, which shrinks coefficients toward
zero without ever reaching it — so Ridge ranks rather than selects, and the tool
takes the top K by weight. Ridge handles correlated features more gracefully
than Lasso, which tends to pick one of a correlated pair arbitrarily and zero
the other.

**Tree importance.** Build `nTrees` estimators on bootstrap samples, each seeing
a random `√p` subset of the features, and total up the impurity reduction each
feature achieves. Gini for a categorical target, variance for a continuous one.

**Be precise about what these "trees" are.** Each one is a **single split** — a
decision stump. The code picks the best split point among twenty candidates for
each feature in the subset, keeps the best feature, and adds its gain. There is
no recursion and no depth. So this measures *how good each feature is on its
own, at its single best cut point*, averaged over many random feature subsets.
That is a reasonable and fast importance signal, and it is not what a real
random forest's importance measures, which includes splits made deep inside a
tree conditional on splits above them.

**RFE.** Recursive feature elimination normally means: fit a model, drop the
weakest feature, refit, repeat. This implementation does not refit a model.
Each round it scores every remaining feature as

```
score = association × (1 − 0.35 × mean |correlation| with the others still in)
```

and drops the lowest, until K remain. So it is a greedy redundancy-aware
elimination rather than model-based RFE — the penalty term is what makes it
recursive in spirit, because removing a feature changes the average correlation
seen by everything left. Useful, but a different thing from the name.

**Forward selection.** Start empty. Repeatedly add whichever remaining feature
maximises the same trade-off — association, discounted by how correlated it is
with what you have already picked (0.2 here rather than 0.35) — until you have K.
Greedy: it never reconsiders an earlier pick.

**Exhaustive search.** Score every possible subset of size K and keep the best,
where a subset's score is its mean association minus 0.3 × its mean pairwise
correlation. This is the only method that can find a set of features that work
well *together* but look mediocre individually. It is also combinatorial, so
**above 15 candidate columns it silently falls back to forward selection.**

### The projection methods

These do not choose columns. They build new ones out of combinations of the old.

- **PCA** finds the directions of greatest variance and re-expresses the data
  along them, each component uncorrelated with the rest. Optionally uses the
  **Kaiser criterion** — keep the components with eigenvalue above 1, meaning
  those explaining more variance than a single original column would.
- **Factor Analysis** looks similar but assumes a different model: that observed
  columns are noisy measurements of a few hidden factors. PCA explains total
  variance; FA explains *shared* variance and leaves per-column noise out.
- **LDA** is the supervised one — it finds the directions that best separate the
  target's classes, rather than the directions of most variance.
- **UMAP** is non-linear, for visualising structure in two dimensions. Distances
  in a UMAP plot are not meaningful in the way PCA distances are.

The trade-off with all four is the same: you may keep more of the information in
fewer columns, and you lose the ability to say what any column means.

## Why these choices

**Why a funnel rather than a menu.** Selection methods disagree, and the
disagreement is informative. Running them in sequence means each one works on a
cleaner set than the last — the correlation filter has already removed the
duplicate before Lasso has to arbitrarily pick one of a correlated pair. The
cost is order-dependence: turning the same methods on in a different order would
give a different answer, and the order is fixed.

**Why every method shows its reason.** A tool that says "we cut 30 columns" is
not usable — you cannot defend the model afterwards. A tool that says
*`age_squared`: high corr* and *`user_id`: low tree imp* lets you overrule it.

**Why several are capped at 500 or 1,000 rows.** Kendall's τ is O(n²) in pairs,
Lasso and Ridge sweep every coefficient over every row 200 times, and this all
happens on the main thread of a browser. The caps are the difference between an
answer and a frozen tab. The sample is taken by even stride rather than at
random, which is reproducible and would be wrong on a file sorted by the target.

**Why the correlation filter breaks ties with the target.** Dropping by column
order is common and arbitrary. Keeping the one that predicts better costs one
extra lookup and is the decision you would have made by hand.

## How to read the output

- **The reason list is the output.** Everything else is a summary of it. Read
  the reasons before the counts.
- **A column dropped by only one gate is a soft call.** One dropped by four is
  not.
- **Kept count versus dropped count** tells you whether your thresholds are
  doing anything. Dropping 2 of 60 means the gates are open too wide; keeping 3
  of 60 means you have almost certainly thrown away signal.
- **Scores are normalised to the best column in each method,** so the top
  feature always reads 1.00. They are comparable within a method and not across
  methods.
- **An `RFE r1` label means it went first** — the weakest of all. `r12` means it
  survived eleven rounds.
- **Retrain and compare.** The number that matters is whether the model got
  worse. If the score holds with a third of the columns, the cut was free.

## Limits

- **The association score is linear.** A non-linear relationship is invisible to
  it, and to almost every gate that uses it. This is the single most important
  limitation in the tool.
- **Only numeric columns are candidates.** Categorical columns pass through
  untouched — they are never scored and never dropped, so a useless text column
  survives everything.
- **The order is fixed.** Gates apply in the listed sequence, and the result
  depends on it.
- **Everything is fit on the whole file.** As with the other browser tools, if
  you split this narrowed CSV for training afterwards, the selection has already
  seen your test rows. Feature selection performed on all the data before a split
  is a well-known way to produce an optimistic score — the honest version runs
  inside the cross-validation loop.
- **"Trees" are stumps, "RFE" does not refit, "mutual information" is a
  Gaussian approximation.** All three are reasonable fast versions. None is the
  textbook algorithm the name implies.
- **Exhaustive search stops being exhaustive above 15 columns** and quietly
  becomes forward selection.
- **Sampling caps** mean Lasso, Ridge, Kendall and the trees see at most 500 or
  1,000 rows.
- **No stability check.** Selection on a resample can give a different answer,
  and the tool runs once.

## Likely interview questions

**"Why remove features at all? Won't the model just ignore the useless ones?"**
A tree will mostly ignore them, but not for free — every useless column is a
candidate at every split, so it costs training time and adds a chance of a
spurious split, which is worse on small data. A linear or distance-based model
does not ignore them at all. And beyond accuracy there is inference cost, the
number of fields a production system has to collect and validate, and whether a
human can read the explanation.

**"Filter, wrapper, embedded — what's the difference?"**
A filter scores each feature against the target with a statistic and never
trains a model: variance, correlation, ANOVA F, χ². Cheap and model-agnostic. A
wrapper trains a model on subsets and uses its score to choose: RFE, forward
selection, exhaustive search. Expensive and tailored to that model. Embedded
methods select as part of fitting: Lasso's L1 penalty is the classic. This tool
has all three families, which is why the funnel has twelve stages.

**"Why does Lasso zero coefficients when Ridge doesn't?"**
The shape of the penalty. The L1 constraint region is a diamond with corners on
the axes, and the corners are where a coefficient is exactly zero — an ellipse of
constant error is likely to first touch it at a corner. The L2 region is a
circle with no corners, so the optimum lands with all coefficients small but
non-zero. That is why Lasso selects and Ridge only shrinks.

**"Two features correlate at 0.95. Which do you drop?"**
By default the one with the weaker link to the target, which is what this tool
does. But I would check first whether they are actually the same measurement
twice or two different things that happen to move together in this sample —
because if it is the latter, the correlation may not hold in production, and
dropping one loses real information. I would also check which is cheaper or more
reliable to collect.

**"Is feature selection before cross-validation a problem?"**
Yes, and it is the classic mistake. If you select features using the whole
dataset and then cross-validate, the selection has already seen the validation
folds, and the reported score is optimistic — sometimes dramatically so on wide,
short data, where you can get a respectable score selecting from pure noise. The
correct version puts selection inside the fold. This tool operates on a whole
file, so I would treat its output as exploration and, for a model I intended to
deploy, put the same steps in a pipeline.

**"What does PCA cost you?"**
Interpretability, mostly. A principal component is a weighted mix of every
original column, so "component 3 is important" tells a stakeholder nothing.
It also assumes the interesting structure lies along high-variance directions,
which is not always true — a low-variance feature can be the one that separates
your classes, and unsupervised PCA will happily discard it. LDA exists precisely
because of that.
