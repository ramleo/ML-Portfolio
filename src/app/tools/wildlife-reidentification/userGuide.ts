# Wildlife Re-Identification — User Guide

## What this tool does
Upload a new sighting photo and a small gallery of past sighting photos
of the same species, and this crops the animal out of each photo, embeds
each crop with a foundation model built specifically for individual
animal re-identification, and ranks the gallery by similarity to the new
sighting — the kind of "is this the same individual returning" question a
backyard camera trap raises.

## Purpose
Originally scoped around a generic vision embedding (DINOv3), but
researched before building anything: **MegaDescriptor**
(BVRA/MegaDescriptor-T-224, from the open-source WildlifeDatasets
toolkit) is the first foundation model built specifically for individual
animal re-identification, and is published to outperform generic
embeddings like CLIP and DINOv2 on this exact task. Using the
purpose-built model instead of a plausible-sounding generic one is the
point — the same discipline as this project's other tools that pick the
real, right technique over a substitute.

## How to use it
1. Upload a **new sighting photo** of an animal.
2. Upload 1-10 **past sighting photos** of the same species — the
   candidates you want to compare the new sighting against.
3. Click **Compare sightings**. The animal is detected and cropped
   automatically in every photo before comparison.
4. Review the ranked results — each past sighting gets a similarity score
   and a qualitative same/uncertain/different label.

## A worked example
Verified with two real photos before this was considered working, since
no genuine backyard-camera-trap dataset was available in this
environment (disclosed here rather than glossed over): comparing the
same photo of two goldfish swimming together, cropped into two separate
individual fish, scored **0.60 similarity, correctly labeled
"different"** — the two fish are visibly similar (same species,
side-by-side) but the model still told them apart. Comparing one fish
crop to itself scored **1.00, correctly labeled "same."**

## Reading the result
- **Each gallery card** — the detected animal label, a cosine similarity
  percentage, and a same/uncertain/different label.
- **Best match** — the single highest-similarity past sighting, called
  out separately.
- **"No animal detected"** means the object detector couldn't find an
  animal in that photo clearly enough (very low resolution or an unusual
  crop can cause this) — not that nothing is there.

## Notes & limits
- **Not a validated identification system.** The same/uncertain/different
  thresholds are informed by one real test (above), not a calibrated
  threshold from a proper multi-individual validation set — none exists
  in this environment. Treat results as "does this look like the same
  individual," never proof.
- **No pose-normalization or multi-crop averaging.** Real wildlife re-ID
  research pipelines use these techniques to improve reliability; this
  tool runs a single crop through a single forward pass per photo.
- **License**: MegaDescriptor is CC-BY-NC-4.0 (non-commercial) — a fit
  for this educational, non-commercial portfolio.
- **Detection quality gates everything.** If the underlying object
  detector can't find the animal in a photo (too small, too low-res, an
  unusual angle), no comparison is possible for that photo.
