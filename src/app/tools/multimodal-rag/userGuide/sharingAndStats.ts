## Sharing a session
Once you've uploaded a document, a "Share this session" chip appears next
to it. Clicking it warns you first, then gives you a link good for 24
hours. Anyone who opens it lands in a read/chat-only view: they can ask
questions and see citations, but can't upload, delete, or re-share. Three
protections apply automatically to that view, none of which touch your own:
1. **Locked to first opener.** Whoever's network opens the link first is
   the only one it works for afterward — forwarding it to someone else
   won't extend access to them.
2. **PII hidden from the AI and the citations.** Anything the detector
   flags (email, phone, SSN, credit card number) is replaced with a
   placeholder like "[REDACTED EMAIL]" before it reaches the shared
   viewer's AI answers or citation text — the AI genuinely can't repeat
   it back to them, no matter how the question is phrased.
3. **Traceable watermark.** A faint, repeating tag (the link's ID and the
   date) is stamped across the shared view's chat and citations. It can't
   stop someone from screenshotting the page, but it means a leaked
   screenshot can be traced back to which link produced it.

You can cut off access at any time with the "Revoke" button, independently
of deleting the document yourself; the link also stops working on its own
after 24 hours either way. A shared viewer's citation cards work the same
as yours otherwise, but the page-image preview and per-document summary
panel are only available in the tab that did the uploading — the share
link carries chat access, not the full workspace.

## Usage stats
A "Usage stats" button in the header opens a dashboard in a pop-up panel,
right here on this page — it never navigates away or disturbs your
current upload/chat session. It shows total uploads by file type, total
questions asked, average answer time, cache hit rate, and which AI
provider actually served each answer (shown as an interactive donut
chart — hover a slice or its legend entry to see that provider's exact
count and share). It only ever shows aggregate counts, never anything
about what any specific person uploaded or asked. Like every upload on
this tool, the numbers reset to zero the next time this demo server
restarts — nothing here is a permanent record.

## What it can't do
- PDF, standalone images (PNG/JPG/GIF/WEBP/BMP/TIFF), CSV, short videos
  (MP4/MOV/WEBM/AVI/MKV), and standalone audio files (MP3/WAV/M4A/OGG/
  FLAC/AAC) are all supported (CSV rows up to 500, video: up to 6 sampled
  frames — fewer once a real transcript exists — plus an audio transcript
  when present); DOCX and XLSX are not — see the separate Document
  Intelligence tool for DOCX.
- A standalone audio upload doesn't need to be part of a video — it gets
  transcribed on its own, with a player and the same searchable transcript
  as a video's audio track. A "Speech only" warning icon appears since
  music or instrumental audio may transcribe inaccurately (there's no
  speech for it to actually pick up).
- A video's visual understanding only comes from a handful of sampled
  frames, not every frame — something that flashes on screen briefly
  between samples could be missed, even though the audio transcript (if
  present) covers the entire runtime.
- It won't fabricate an answer that isn't in the document/image — if nothing
  relevant is found, it says so instead of guessing.
- Nothing uploaded here is permanent. For document field extraction with
  human-editable results and export, use Document Intelligence instead.

## Your data is not stored anywhere permanently
The original PDF, image, or CSV you upload is never saved — only the
extracted text, table, figure-caption, or image-caption chunks are indexed.
A video is the one exception: its raw file is kept in memory for this
session only, specifically so you can play it back and click-to-seek in
the transcript — capped to only a few videos in memory at once, evicted
immediately when you remove the document, and never written to disk.
Everything here lives only in this server's temporary memory for as long
as it keeps running. There is no database backup, no export of your file
to any other system, and no persistence layer behind this demo. A server
restart (which can happen at any time on this free-tier demo) wipes
everything — every upload, its chunks, and any "shared" copy — with no way
to recover it. Treat this as a scratch space for trying the tool, not a
place to keep anything you need later.
