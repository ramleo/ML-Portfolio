# Photo Library Visual Search — User Guide

## What this tool does
Upload a batch of photos, then describe in plain language what you're
looking for — "the red backpack", "a dog on a beach", "a whiteboard with
diagrams" — and every photo gets ranked by how well it matches your
description. No tagging or captioning step first: this uses CLIP, a model
trained to understand images and text in the same "space," so it can
compare a sentence directly against a photo's visual content.

## How to use it
1. Click **Add photo(s)** and select as many images as you want to search
   through (you can add more photos in multiple batches — they all stay in
   the pool together).
2. Type what you're looking for into the search box and click **Search**
   (or press Enter).
3. Photos re-sort with the best match first, each showing a match
   percentage badge.

## Reading the match percentage
The percentage is **relative to this batch and this search only** — it
shows how much better a photo matches your description compared to the
others in the same search, not an absolute confidence score. A 100% match
means "the best fit among the photos you uploaded," not "certainly this."
Searching the same photos with a different description can reorder and
re-score everything.

## What this is (and isn't)
CLIP compares overall visual meaning, not exact objects or text in the
image — it's very good at broad scenes, colors, and concepts, but a very
specific or unusual description (an exact brand logo, a precise count of
objects) may not rank as cleanly. Nothing is stored between searches:
photos and results only exist in your browser tab for that session.

## Notes & limits
- No API cost — CLIP runs locally on the backend, no external calls.
- Every search re-embeds the whole photo batch, so a very large batch
  (dozens of photos) will take a little longer per search than a small one.
- This is search over a batch you upload in-session, not a persistent
  photo library — nothing is saved after you leave the page.
